        <h2>About the Conference</h2>
        <p>
            "Sequences and Their Applications (SETA)" is recognized as an internationally leading conference, with its primary focus centered on the exploration of sequences and their significant applications in modern information and communication technologies. 
            Sequences in discrete structures have close connections with error-correcting codes, Boolean functions and combinatorial designs. They play important roles in numerous critical domains,
            encompassing areas such as spread spectrum communication systems, global positioning systems, ranging systems, circuit testing, software testing, channel estimation, cryptographic schemes, and beyond. 
            Over the years, this esteemed conference has been hosted in a variety of international locales, highlighting its global significance. Previous editions of SETA include
